            This project centers on designing the Peregrine, an advanced business jet that balances innovation, efficiency, and sustainability. Built by a collaborative team, the Peregrine incorporates cutting-edge features tailored for optimal performance and environmental impact. The aircraft is equipped with dual modified hybrid turboprop PT6A-61 engines and powered by solid-state batteries, supporting both fuel efficiency and lower emissions. With a streamlined straight wing design featuring tapered leading and trailing edges, and a T-tail configuration, the jet combines aerodynamic efficiency with structural robustness.

            Designed for single-pilot operation and accommodating nine passengers with one cabin crew, the Peregrine integrates modern touches like electrically retractable nose landing gear and morphing wings to enhance flight adaptability. The design achieves an impressive 49.2% reduction in fuel burn, with the added benefit of being 100% recyclable, setting new standards in sustainable aviation. Priced competitively with an accessible financing plan, this business jet not only redefines luxury travel but also champions a more environmentally conscious approach to aviation.
