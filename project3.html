            This project explores sustainable energy conversion by designing a miniature vehicle powered by a thermoelectric generator. The vehicle utilizes a small DC motor to drive motion, with energy supplied by a thermoelectric generator that captures heat from a simple tea light candle. As the candle heats one side of the thermoelectric module, the temperature difference generates electricity, which powers the motor. This innovative setup enables the car to move autonomously, even attempting inclined ramps.

            Through careful design and analysis, the project focuses on maximizing thermodynamic efficiency and optimizing the vehicle's performance under minimal power conditions. The carâ€™s simplicity highlights the potential of thermoelectric generators as an alternative energy source, converting readily available heat into useful work. This approach offers an accessible demonstration of renewable energy concepts, blending mechanical and thermal engineering principles in a compact, functional model.
